 ## INTRO

A small, independent restaurant prides itself on its use of fresh local produce and its constantly changing menu and wishes to obtain a website which showcases this. It envisages a site which will allow prospective customers and other members of the general public to view its current lunch and dinner menus and which will allow members of its staff to login and update the menus on a daily basis. 

This repo is primary for the web application and will use:

- React JS
- JavaScript
- Node.js
